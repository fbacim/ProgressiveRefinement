# ProgressiveRefinement

This project requires Vizard 5. Three main files that can be run: 
- ProgressiveRefinement.py containing a demo in the supermarket environment of all techniques developed for my first two studies, as well as prototypes for improved ones;
- Study3.1-abstract.py containing the experiment file which includes the final versions of all techniques used in the shootout study in the abstract environment;
- Study3.2-supermarket.py containing the experiment file which includes the final versions of all techniques used in the shootout study in the supermarket environment.

GitHub has a file size limit of 100MB, so I had to compress a few files into zips before pushing them. Make sure you unzip test.zip, finalM2.zip and finalM-study.zip before you try to run anything.
